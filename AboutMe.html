									<h1>About Me<br />
									And My Story</h1>
									<p>For over 4 years now I have studied the art of coding, trying to maintain knowledge of
										different programming languages. I was always facinated by programming, and what people had 
									built with it!.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/beginstory.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>When I was in High-School, I studied Computer Science, learning Python, being my first programming language, and build small projects
									such as timers and alarm clocks. Overtime, I passed the course and went to continue my study of Computer Science at College. Within this i learnt how to create basic websites, and even learnt SQL for containing databases.
									Outside of college i continued to study languages, creating projects that would help me to adapt towards the designated language i had chosen. During this time i create projects such as "Web Scrapers", "Ecomerce websites", and even Java projects such as "Ticket Systems". I have always wanted to design and create projects like these due to my passion of one day hopefully becoming a software engineer; creating applications, and maintaining database information to a high extent.				</p>
								<p>My college course lasted 3 years, and once finished i came out with the following grade: Distinction* Distinction* Distinction (D*D*D). Having such a high qualification allowed me to go further, creating projects for others online in exchange for a small profit. These would include making Ecomerce Websites, or helping someone organize large database files with SQL and PHP. As time went on, I decided to open up a Linkdln account, to show my set of skills and demonstrate what I have accomplished over the years. Doing this allowed me to gain a following which is still growing today. To this day, I know the following programming languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and SQL. Using these languages have allowed me to create various projects. However, I am still learning everyday, trying to masture all 6 of these, to gain a better understanding, whilst trying to adaprt towards new languages that will benefit me as a software engineer one day.
